# Lab | Working with question + answer data


## For this Lab you have two options - choose one. Your primary tool today will be Tableau but you can use any other method from your data analysis toolkit: 

### 1) Easier challenge - no data engineering needed 

Utilising the American obesity data from the class materials Unit 6 > Day 1 > Data manipulate the data in tableau and plot using stacked bars, histograms, line charts or area charts, the changes in adult obesity over time - you can choose to focus on any aspect of demographics: age range, gender or education level, but the message we want to clearly see is change over time. 

Ideally we would end up with an interactive chart  (or dashboard) which allows an external party to view and explore the changing obesity trend in selected states of the USA.

### 2) Intermediate challenge - you will need to reshape the data 

Utilising the data set labelled 'humour' in the class materials Unit 6 > Day 1 > Data you will first load the questionnaire results (data.csv) in tableau and then connect to the txt file which contains the questions. Note when connecting to the text file you will need to set the correct field separator. 

a)  Blend the data using Edit Blend Relationships in the Data drop down menu in Tableau and set the primary aliases as the question names following these instructions

- OR 

a) Relate the two data sources on the question number so you can utilise the question name as a lookup field for the primary data source with the responses. 

b) once your data is reshaped you will be able to select a subset of contradictory or complementary questions to use for ad hoc analysis in tableau  - you can do this by reviewing the text of the questions being asked or by looking at the correlation between responses. Consider applying a filter in the workbook so that only some of the questions are included in the final visuals

c) In this challenge the focus is on contrast - by age, gender or perceived accuracy - which of the questions when considered together indicate an interesting contrast ? 

Ideally we would end up with an interactive chart  (or dashboard) which allows an external party to view and explore perspectives on humour in the respondents to this questionnaire.
